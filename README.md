## Sometimes It's Best To Empty It All Out

One of the biggest hinderances to productivity is a cluttered mind. For those of us who don't like journaling, this may be one of the most useful websites you'll ever come across.
The Note Taker Application provides an archive where you can jot down your ideas, whether they be professional or personal. You can utilize different routes to view your entire list of notes. And when you decide a note is no longer needed, you can click the trash can icon next to the title of the note and have it removed from your database of notes.So when you need a place to write it all down to view later, I hope you'll choose the Note Taker app!

## Installation

If you would like to use the Note Taker app, please [click here](heroku link).
If you would like to view the github repository for this website, [click here](https://github.com/Aikeh2021/Note-Taker).


## Usage

To use this website properly, navigate to the website and click "Get started." From there, you'll be redirected to the notes page where you can enter a title for the note and give it some content. When you have finished writing a note, click the save icon in the upper right hand corner. The save note will appear on the left hand side of the screen. To view the title and contents of all of the notes in your database, enter the route parameters (/api/notes).
